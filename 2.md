# Installation

### Requirements

* Python (we're using Python 2.7.4, Python 3 will not be needed)
* Text editor or IDE (Sublime Text 2 recommended)
* Database Server (MySQL will do)
* pip (Python packages require to install it. <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html"> Installation Guide </a>)



### First step - install Django

	pip install Django==1.5

This command will install Django framework and the necessary tools.


### Second step - install MySQL binding
Since we will use MySQL with Django, we will have to install MySQL libraries

	pip install MySQL-python
	

This package is compiled from C, so you need to install several dependencies (such as Python and C header MySQL). However, if your system does not have all the all the dependencies then keep installing all the packages by following the Error Messages.

Installation on Debian and Ubuntu is quite simple.
	
	sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
	
This one is all you need to install, package manager will then install MySQL binding.


### Django version

We will be using Django version 1.5 for this tutorial. So check the version you have 

	django-admin.py --version
	
By running this command we get to know the version of Django and if it's 1.5 then we have installed the right version
