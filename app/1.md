## First Application

### Project App

Django was designed to be very easy to see what can be made from a very complex websites. Each small part of the website can be treated as an app. Each project can have one or more apps.

When working on this project you will slowly grasp the concepts. Giving you an example: You will need to design a website for a newspaper company. In addition to the blog, there will be regular news, some people can write on the blog. The project may be a 'foobar', some apps that may be in the project are ` news`, `blog` ... etc.

			foobar
					--news
					--blogs
					...

Django is like the skeleton for the entire website. By itself, it's nothing and is just a structure but when all the apps inside it come together and perform their own functionalities, they form an entire website.

### Actual Steps

First we will create a website, which is "Hello World!". The browser will display the text. 
This will help us to get started with a simple form and then build from it.

### Create a new Project

1. Open a terminal window
2. Choose the name of your project (make sure it does not contain spaces). Example: 'helloworldproject'

```bash
django-admin.py startproject helloworldproject
```

This is how the project structure looks like:

		helloworldproject/
			manage.py
			helloworldproject/
				__init__.py
				settings.py
				urls.py
				wsgi.py

Now, our skeleton is ready. Time to add some flesh to it!

### Adding apps to the project

Enter in the first level by running `cd helloworldproject` and then run the following to create the first app

```bash
django-admin.py startapp helloworldapp
```

Now, the folder structure should look something like this:
		helloworldapp
			__init__.py
			models.py
			tests.py
			views.py
			
This is how the entire folder structure looks:

		helloworldproject/
			manage.py
			helloworldapp
				__init__.py
				models.py
				tests.py
				views.py
			helloworldproject/
				__init__.py
				settings.py
				urls.py
				wsgi.py

### Running the development server

Django doesn't need separate installation of a server for development. Go back one level `cd .. ` and run the following command

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see a similar output:

```

Django version 1.5.1, using settings 'helloworldproject.settings'
Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```
This tells us that the Django project is using port 8000 and if go to our browser (http://localhost:8000), we will see our project deployed.

We will run the server every now and then to test our code progress. You can stop the server using Ctrl + C.

### Initial code

### First View

Open up your favorite editor so we can start by first importing HTTPResponse from django.http. 
Open `views.py` in `helloworldproject > helloworldapp` and add the following:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
```
Now we will write a function `Index` (you can name is whatever you please) but it need to accept a parameter / argument. There is an unwritten rule of preferably naming the parameter `request` though you could again, name it as you please.
The request object is of type HTTPResponse.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
	return HttpResponse('Hello World!')
```

If you run the server and check the broser, you'll notice no change in the display message. This is because we are missing the url. Index view is not rendered as we have not entered the url.

### First urlpattern

`helloworldproject> helloworldproject` has a file `urls.py`. In this file, we will be using URL matching. Import the app view in this file:

```python
import helloworldapp.views
```

Notice the line `urlpatterns = patterns ( '',` Based on the urls we pass, Django will decide which view to render.

```python
url(r'^$', helloworldapp.views.index)
```

The object is of url type.
The first argument is a regular expression (something to look up later) and the second argument species the view to be rendered when the requested URL matches the pattern mentioned.

```python
from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
import helloworldapp.views

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^$', helloworldapp.views.index),
)
```

We will dive deeper in understanding urls.py. For now, Congratulations! You have made your first Django app.
Run the sever and checkout http://localhost:8000

## Exercise

1. "Hello World!" Start simple.
2. Try to use HTML instead of plain text.
3. change the view `index` to a different name and accordingly make changes in` urls.py`.
4. Try to make changes in `urlpattern` and see how you can play around with it.
