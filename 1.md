# Before we start

### Introduction to Web Frameworks

I am making the assumption that you are not familiar with Python or any other web frameworks. The simplest way to describe it is that it makes web development much easier. A little history of web frameworks:

Django developers would build websites for big media / magazine companies. Suddenly, one day they realized 'Hey! Daily newspaper websites and most of these others are 90% similar'. So, in other words, they were foolishly writing the same code over and over again.

Then they came up with an idea so that they would not have to write the same code over and over again like a donkey and be able to use it for a variety of projects. Eureka! That's how Django came into existence.

### Advantages of using a framework

Why use a framework? For example, if you want to develop a website for blogging. Writing all the code for a post would be a lot of work and just reinventing the wheel and using something like WordPress would just be a pain.

If you use simple Python / PHP without using a web framework then, you're basically reinventing the wheel for no reason:

1. Database Connection
2. Create SQL tables
3. Write the data in the table, 'UPDATE' and 'INSERT' statements for admin interface
4. Ensure the website is secure (protect from XSS, CSRF, etc)
5. Create optimized SELECT statements since that will be used for a good frontend for visitors

Django takes care of most of the functions mentioned above seamlessly.
